Bugs in Box -- an analogy to the coalescent
[inspired by Joe Felsenstein's verbal 'bugs-in-a-box' analogy]

the Base for the example is a silly ball example from the package pyglet,
that then morphed into the bugs-in-a-box example.

On macs this code needs an older version of pyglet: pyglet 1.5.27
[version 2.0.x fails with 'glBegin not found' or similar
